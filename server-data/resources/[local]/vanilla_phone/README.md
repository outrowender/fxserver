# Phone!
Phone using original scaleforms on [FiveM](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem), also using render targets, but also making your character hold a real phone (fancy flags!)

SOON: Contacts can be expanded using external resources, which can have completely unique behaviour upon calling said contact.

# Usage
Start the resource, simple enough.

Camera works fine too, identical to the [resource released on the forums](https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-cellphone-camera/43599) but improved just slightly.

If you want to contribute to the resource, do so with caution, as the code is a huge mess of re-used and re-purposed code of multiple iterations.
